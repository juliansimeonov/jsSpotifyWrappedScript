Hello there. 

Thanks for trying out my accurate Spotify Wrapped python script! Some things to note before using:
1. The script is written such that it pulls from Spotify data that you manually download from their website (found in the privacy settings).
2. Your Spotify data must be copied into the exact same folder as where you have the SpotifyWrapped python script saved as the script pulls only from files saved in the same folder.
3. The script doesn't look at dates of when songs/artists were streamed. If you have the same file saved multiple times it will treat each file as its own. It also won't give specific annual wrapped data, will just analyze whatever data you have in your StreamingHistory files.
4. The script will create four .csv files in the same folder as where the .py file is saved. These will have your most streamed artists and songs sorted by time streamed and # of plays.
